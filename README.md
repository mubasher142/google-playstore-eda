Google Play Store Apps - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project provides an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Google Play Store apps dataset. By uncovering the patterns, trends, and actionable insights behind app success on the world's largest mobile platform, this analysis aims to inform developers, businesses, and researchers interested in the app ecosystem.

📊 Project Overview
Objective: To analyze the characteristics of Google Play Store apps and identify the factors that influence app popularity, ratings, and user engagement.

Dataset: A cleaned dataset covering over 10,000 apps with details including category, reviews, installs, price, ratings, and more.

Scope: The analysis covers data preprocessing, insightful visualizations, category-wise trends, and findings about free vs. paid apps, content rating, and user preferences.

🔍 Key Steps
Data Cleaning

Standardized data formats (size, installs, price).

Removed duplicate entries and handled missing values.

Exploratory Analysis

Category distribution, popularity, and engagement.

Comparative insights on free vs. paid apps.

Content rating and genre breakdowns.

Visualization

Bar charts, histograms, and boxplots visualize the key variables and trends.

📝 Findings & Insights
Free apps dominate both the number and total downloads compared to paid apps.

FAMILY and GAME categories have the largest app counts and highest installs.

Most apps are rated for Everyone, supporting broad reach.

Ratings for most apps are above 4, suggesting overall user satisfaction.

Regular data cleaning (de-duplication, handling outliers) is essential for meaningful results.
